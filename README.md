# Chess_Project

Implemented a solution for the Chess game, with options to play player vs player, or a  player agains the computer, which only executes random moves.

The project is implemented using the PyGame Module.

The architecture follows the MVC (model-view-controller) software pattern, separating the user interface, from the data (the game board and it's properties, the game options, etc.) and the controlling logic.

The initial advancements of the project follow the step provided in this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBwF487qi8MGU81nDGaeNE1EnNEPYWKY_ , to which I give credit for the way to implement the game loop, and the GameState class, which handles the logic of the data.
